# vibe
Vibe is vibecoded entirely by OpenAI's Codex. None of this code was written by a human.

At the beginning of every task, Codex is prompted with `Use AGENTS.md to figure out what to do`.\
After it completes a task, it is prompted again with `Keep going.`. However, if it does something which prevents me from pushing its changes, I will prompt it to refactor the change.

All commits made by a human will be prefixed with [HUMAN].

Codex is instructed not to read this file.
